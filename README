This software supports the linear book scanner. It has been tested on
MacOS and Ubuntu 12.04. Instructions for Ubuntu follow.  If you have
complete and working hardware, you may begin scanning by running the
top level script.

$ ./scan

=== top level directory ===

The top level directory contains the run script mentioned above, and a
viewer. The viewer is GUI application for display and minor
manipulation of scanned images. It lives in the top level directory
and may be run independently of the hardware.

$ sudo apt-get install python-pygame     # required
$ sudo apt-get install python-reportlab  # strongly recommended
$ sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr     # optional
$ ./monitor.py testdata                  # self test, no hardware required

=== motor subdirectory ===

This directory contains software for an mDrive microcontroller. This
assembly language program controls image synchronization, integration
with the break beam sensor, and motor control.  The majority of the
files are for debug purposes only, for example manual motor movement
commands, or a sensor diagnosis program to help aim the break beam
sensor during hardware construction. For programming reference,
consult your favorite internet search engine for "Programming and
Software Reference for: MCode". To program the motors, run the
following command.

$ ./program_motors

=== sane subdirectory ===

This directory contains patches to SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy).
The patch is required to allow the off the shelf scanning hardware to
run in a modified state; for example disabling paper sensors or
changing calibration routines. You must retrieve the SANE source code,
apply these patches, and install them on the computer attached to the
hardware. These example commands are beyond the scope of this
document; consult a local Linux expert as needed.

$ sudo apt-get install pbuilder
$ apt-get source sane-backends
$ patch -p0 < sane-canon-dr.diff
$ sudo pbuilder --build sane-backends-*.dsc
$ sudo dpkg -i /var/cache/pbuilder/result/sane-backends*.deb

=== testdata subdirectory ===

This directory contains a limited number of sample images. Their sole
purpose is to help test and verify the viewer program, even in the
complete absence of working hardware.
