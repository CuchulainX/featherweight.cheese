Welcome, gentle reader.

This software drives a featherweight book scanner. It was developed
under Ubuntu but may work on other platforms as well. To verify the
software is working correctly, run the "benchmark" program and make
sure no errors are displayed.

==================================

Dependencies

python-numeric      computation
python-pygame       user interface
netpbm              testing

==================================

It is not trivial to print a lifesize SVG file. One way is to use
Firefox on Linux to produce a PDF, then use Adobe Reader to send to
the printer. For Firefox, Print > Print to File > Page Setup > Paper
size: Tabloid > Options > Uncheck "Ignore Scaling and Shrink To Fit
Page Width" > set everything to --blank-- in Header and Footer. For
Adobe Reader, set the paper size to 11 x 17 inches, and maximize the
print resolution.

==================================

Print the source code as a pamphlet

enscript --indent=10 --fancy-header --highlight=python \
  --media=tabloid --portrait --nup=2 --color=1 --nup-xpad=72 \
  --nup-ypad=72 --style=emacs --underlay="Cheese"  -o foo.ps *.py

lp -o media=tabloid -o ColorModel=CMYK -o sides=two-sided-short-edge foo.ps

==================================

This patch against sane-backends will physically destroy an unmodified
scanning device. You have been warned.
